- 👋 Hi, I’m @CakeLU
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, cooking, and going on new adventures! League of Legends is my main go-to, Kingdom Hearts is my all-time favorite!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CSS, JS, React, Structured Text (PLCs), Swift/Xcode, and Unity!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any cool new tech projects. It's been hard for me to do programming outside of my primary job unfortunately.
- 📫 Feel free to contact me on Instagram (@cakepoplu) or email me at ss2salah@gmail.com!
